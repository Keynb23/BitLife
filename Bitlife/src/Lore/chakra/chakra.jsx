// Chakra (チャクラ, Chakura) is a supernatural substance[1][2] native to lifeforms on some planets. Due to it being the component to create Chakra Fruit, the Ōtsutsuki Clan travel from planet to planet to absorb all the chakra on them in order to create the fruit to consume. To release chakra means to bring out physical and spiritual energy and mix it together within one's body.[3]

// Origin
// Hagoromo With Followers
// Hagoromo connecting with others through ninshū.

// According to Madara, whose knowledge comes Hagoromo's Stone Tablet,[4] which was adulterated by Black Zetsu,[5] humans on Earth didn't have chakra until Hamura and Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki were born with it,[6] which was a result of their mother Kaguya eating their planet's chakra fruit from the God Tree. Hagoromo spread chakra to others through a practice called ninshū, intending to create peace by using the chakra to connect people's spiritual energy so that they would understand one another without even talking. However, the people did not use chakra in the way Hagoromo hoped, instead using it to connect their inner spiritual and physical energies. They kneaded their inner chakra to amplify and weaponise it, creating what is now known as ninjutsu.[7]

// According to Jura, a God Tree who gained self-awareness, their purpose is collect the chakra of all living things, all current and past life on a planet, and create a chakra fruit,[8] suggesting that some form of chakra predates Kaguya's eating of the chakra fruit, on Earth and other worlds consumed by the Ōtsutsuki.

// Overview
// Chakra is essential to even the most basic jutsu. Through various methods, the most common of which is hand seals, chakra can be controlled and manipulated to create an effect that would not be possible otherwise, such as walking on water, exhaling fire, or creating illusions. Chakra is ordinarily not visible to the unaided eye unless it is highly concentrated or manifested in large amounts. This is rarely seen due to the restrictions of eight specific tenketsu known as the Eight Gates, which limit the amount of chakra an individual can release at a single given time.

// Chakra Circulatory System
// The Chakra Pathway System.

// Since being spread by Hagoromo, better known as the Sage of Six Paths, chakra has become a form of life energy that all individuals produce to some degree; those who expend all their chakra will die.[9][10] Produced within and manipulated by organs such as the heart,[11] the energy circulates throughout the body in a network called the "Chakra Pathway System", which is similar to the cardiovascular system. Groups such as shinobi have learned to generate more chakra and release it outside their bodies through pressure points called tenketsu in order to perform jutsu.

// Chakra Moulding Diagram (Normal)
// The two components of chakra: physical energy and spiritual energy.

// Chakra is created when two more primal energies, known collectively as one's "stamina" (スタミナ, sutamina), are moulded together. Physical energy (身体エネルギー, shintai enerugī) is collected from each of the body's cells and can be increased through training, stimulants, and exercise. Spiritual energy (精神エネルギー, seishin enerugī, English TV: Mental Energy) is derived from the mind's consciousness and can be increased through studying, meditation, and experience.[12] These two energies becoming more powerful will in turn make the created chakra more powerful. Therefore, practising a technique repeatedly will build up experience, increasing one's spiritual energy, and thus allowing more chakra to be created. As a result, the ninja is able to do that same technique with more power. This same cycle applies for physical energy, except the ninja needs to increase their endurance instead. Some unique individuals have substantial potential that enables them to exponentially increase their chakra reserves in a relatively short amount of time.

// At any given time, a ninja will have a "maximum" amount of chakra that they can form and use before it runs out and they need to rest to replenish it. With practice this maximum can be increased, but to a certain extent as they are limited to the quantity and strength of chakra that their genetics grants them.[13] For instance, Kakashi Hatake has average chakra reserves, but no amount of training can grant him the same amount of chakra as Naruto Uzumaki whom he stated had more chakra than himself.[14] If a body is given far more chakra than it is able to handle, then the body would potentially be killed by the overwhelming chakra, as Fūka had to divide the chakra she absorbed into different bodies, a Kumo-nin who ate Gyūki's chakra meat tentacle died instead of acquiring part of its power, and the reason why Isshiki Ōtsutsuki chose not to resurrect in Jigen's body due to it being unable to handle his massive chakra. On the opposite spectrum, if somebody runs out of chakra, they potentially risk death.[15]

// Each person's chakra is different and as such gives off a unique chakra signature, which sensor type ninja are able to detect. Chakra signatures are passed genetically, allowing a person's clan to be identified by their chakra;[16] over time, entire populations can have perceptibly different chakra.[17] One's chakra signature can be altered by absorbing DNA from multiple people, mixing various chakra signatures together to become a whole new one.[18] In the anime, chakra signatures that are similar to each other (such as those of siblings, or a parent and child) are suggested to resonate when near each other.[19] Each person's chakra also has a unique "colour" that can be seen by those with dōjutsu (the anime tends to colour all normal chakra light blue). Even if they are separated, changes made in the chakra signature of the original will result in the separated chakra mimicking those changes.[20]

// While practically all types of jutsu require chakra to be performed, taijutsu does not; stamina is all that is needed. While the ninja still needs a set amount of chakra to live, regular taijutsu doesn't require any active moulding or manipulation of chakra, with few exceptions. A standard attack like a punch or kick falls into this technique category.

// Chakra Control
// Because chakra takes time and a great deal of training to gradually build up, the key to its use is not actually having large amounts of chakra but instead being able to sufficiently control and conserve it.[21] This is called Chakra Control (チャクラコントロール , Chakura Kontorōru). In order to have good chakra control, a ninja should only mould as much chakra as they need to perform any given jutsu or ability with maximum efficiency.[22] If they mould more chakra than is needed, the excess chakra is wasted and they will tire out faster from its loss.[23] If they don't mould enough chakra, a technique will not be performed effectively, if at all, likely creating problems in a combat situation.[24] Because chakra consists in part of spiritual energy, the user is more easily able to mould the correct amount of chakra by remaining calm and focused.[25]

// General training methods for improving one's moulding and manipulation of chakra are the Leaf Concentration, Tree Climbing, and Water Surface Walking exercises. A good way to build up chakra in the body is to spin it into a tight spiral; Whether to spin the chakra left or right is dependent on the way the user's hair grows.[26] Hand seals are often used to manipulate chakra more easily, allowing shinobi to execute their techniques faster and more effectively. Shinobi who are extremely skilled at chakra control often specialise in genjutsu or become medical-nin.

// A more casual use is using chakra control to sober one's self after consuming alcohol. Mei Terumī displays this ability when Shino advises her not to get too drunk during their meeting.

// Chakra can also be used for general performance enhancement. By moulding the chakra into key points of the body, usually the hands or feet, it will greatly augment their physical prowess. Certain shinobi are able rely on this skill to gain a speed boost, acquire a sixth sense, and even perform superhuman strikes. As shown in the anime, moulding one's chakra can also improve mental prowess, allowing them to process information more efficiently.[27]

// When creating a ninjutsu, the two methods of manipulating chakra are referred to as shape transformation and nature transformation:

// Shape transformation deals with controlling the form, movement, and potency of one's chakra, determining the size, range, and purpose of a technique.
// Nature transformation deals with the moulding and defining of the nature of one's chakra, altering its properties and characteristics for use in techniques. There is also the nature transformations of Yin and Yang, which deals with changing the ratio of spiritual and physical energies within chakra.
// These two methods can be implemented separately or together in order to create a technique, though ninja who can use both simultaneously are said to be rare.

// Types of Chakra
// Tailed Beast Chakra
// Initial jinchūriki form
// Tailed beast chakra.

// Main article: Tailed Beasts
// The tailed beasts (尾獣, bijū), sometimes referred to as "Chakra Monsters" (チャクラのバケモノ, Chakura no Bakemono),[28] are the nine titanic living forms of chakra created by the Sage of Six Paths out of the chakra from Earth's Ten-Tails.[29][30] They are differentiated by the number of tails they have, ranging from one to nine. A tailed beast's chakra is coloured red.

// Senjutsu Chakra
// Senjutsu Chakra
// Senjutsu chakra.

// Main article: Senjutsu
// Senjutsu (仙術, English TV: Sage Jutsu, literally meaning: Sage Techniques) are a specialised field of jutsu that involve the use of natural energy. Senjutsu practitioners, known as sages, learn to draw natural energy inside their bodies, blending it with their own chakra to create senjutsu chakra (仙術チャクラ, senjutsu chakura, English TV: Sage Jutsu Chakra). This chakra adds a new dimension of power to the user's techniques, while also allowing for the use of techniques that would not otherwise be possible.

// Absorption Chakra
// Gedo Mazo soul removal
// Absorption chakra.

// Absorption Chakra (吸引チャクラ, Kyūin Chakura)[31] is produced by the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path, and can be released from its mouth in the form of phantom dragons. Any chakra that touches these dragons sticks to them,[32] which allows them to kill human beings in an instant. The Sealing Technique: Phantom Dragons Nine Consuming Seals utilises nine of these dragons to extract tailed beast chakra from a jinchūriki or directly seal the beast into the statue, though sealing such a large amount of chakra requires several days.

// Six Paths
// Naruto and Sasuke obtain Rikudo Power
// Hagoromo gifting Naruto and Sasuke.

// Six Paths (六道, Rikudō) is a term used frequently towards the end of the series with little explanation of what it actually is. Several characters are mentioned to have the chakra or power of Six Paths, but it's unclear to what extent these terms differ:

// Six Paths Chakra (六道チャクラ, Rikudō Chakura) — used by Naruto Uzumaki and Madara Uchiha to float.[33]
// Six Paths Sage Chakra (六道の仙人チャクラ, Rikudō no Sennin Chakura) — applied by Naruto to his Truth-Seeking Balls, allowing him to damage Madara's shadows.[34]
// Sage of Six Paths Power (六道仙人の力, Rikudō Sennin no Chikara) — said to be the source of Sasuke Uchiha's Amenotejikara and Naruto's Truth-Seeking Balls.[35]
// Six Paths Power (六道の力, Rikudō no Chikara) — temporarily gained by Kakashi Hatake while his body is inhabited by the spirit of Obito Uchiha, enhancing the power of his eye technique.[36] Sasuke can also apply it to his Chidori, darkening its colour and also allowing it to damage Madara.[37]
// Six Paths Yin Power (六道の陰の力, Rikudō no In no Chikara) and Six Paths Yang Power (六道の陽の力, Rikudō no Yō no Chikara) — two special powers given to Naruto and Sasuke by Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, which can be used to seal Madara[38] or even Kaguya Ōtsutsuki.[39]
// Hamura's Chakra
// Twin Lions Crumbling Attack
// Hinata using Hamura's chakra.

// Like Hagoromo's, Hamura Ōtsutsuki's chakra has special properties and is essentially the same as Six Paths Chakra, passed through the bloodlines of the Ōtsutsuki and Hyūga clans. Only those with Hamura's chakra can touch (and thus destroy) the Tenseigan and are immune to its effects. Interestingly, when using the chakra she received from Hamura, Hinata Hyūga's chakra turned a dark purple in colour.

// Gift of the Hermit Group
// Raigō Senjusatsu
// Gift of the Hermit Group chakra.

// Main article: Gift of the Hermit Group
// The Gift of the Hermit Group (仙族の才, Senzoku no Sai, English TV: Gift of the Sages) is a special kind of chakra used by the ninja monks of the Fire Temple. It requires daily, unrelenting training to master. This chakra is required to unseal the Sealed Iron Wall granting access to the Fire Temple. It is also required for the technique Welcoming Approach: Thousand-Armed Murder.

// Star Chakra
// Mysterious Peacock Method
// Mysterious Peacock Method chakra.

// Main article: Mysterious Peacock Method
// Seen in the anime, shinobi from Hoshigakure can manipulate their chakra into a wide variety of skills by using the chakra-enhancing meteorite, albeit at the cost of extreme damage to their bodies. Hoshigakure's method gets its name, Mysterious Peacock, from the chakra's raw manifestation as pinkish-purple chakra tails similar to a peacock's tail feathers.

// Negative Chakra
// Shino Possessed
// Negative Chakra.

// Negative Chakra is used as nourishment for Nue to explode.[40] It is also used by Nue and Sumire to, when given to another person, take control of them and their negative emotions.

// Dark Chakra
// Shadow arms
// The Zero-Tails' shadow arms.

// Main article: Zero-Tails
// Seen in Naruto Shippūden the Movie: Bonds, Dark Chakra (闇のチャクラ, Yami no Chakura) is a special chakra formed from the negative emotions of the heart. Created by the Zero-Tails as it feeds on the negative emotions of the people around it, it is shown to be extremely powerful, being used to power the Land of the Sky's Ancor Vantian and grants Shinnō powerful techniques with seemingly no drawbacks. However, it requires proper chakra control to use, and disruption in the control can cause a damaging backlash, as Shinnō's body heavily deteriorated when his control was sabotaged.

// Priestess Chakra
// Protective Sphere of Light
// The priestess light chakra.

// Main article: Bell (charm)
// Seen in Naruto Shippūden the Movie, Priestess Chakra (巫女チャクラ, Miko Chakura) has a bright and unique aspect. It can send pink rays of severing light at the user, Shion's, opponents, create a light barrier to shield her from darkness, and transform her into an angelic form. She also used the mystical chakra of the bell to create a protective sphere around a designated target, as she did for Naruto Uzumaki, and use the chakra with Naruto to form the Super Chakra Rasengan. Miroku feared that if Shion is corrupted, her powers would be deadlier than a gigantic demon's.

// Ryūmyaku Chakra
// The Source of the Ryūmyaku
// The Ryūmyaku chakra source.

// Main article: Ryūmyaku
// Seen in Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower, the Ryūmyaku (龍脈, English TV: Ley Line, literally meaning: Dragon Veins) is an ancient source of chakra that flows under Rōran, granting anyone who harnesses it infinite chakra reserves. Only the heirs of the kingdom's royal bloodline can open or close the flow, but after it's opened, anyone can use it.
