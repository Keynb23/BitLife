// In the Naruto universe, the Tailed Beast Ball is a powerful technique used
// by Tailed Beasts and their Jinchuriki. It involves gathering and compressing both positive
// (black) and negative (white) chakra into a sphere, which is then released as a
// destructive blast or beam. The technique's power is relative to the user's
// chakra and can be enhanced by combining multiple Tailed Beast Balls.
