// The tailed beasts (尾獣, bijū), sometimes referred to as "Chakra Monsters" (チャクラのバケモノ, Chakura no Bakemono),[1] are the nine titanic living forms of chakra created by the Sage of Six Paths out of the chakra from Earth's Ten-Tails.[2][3] They are differentiated by the number of tails they have, ranging from one to nine.

// The young tailed beasts with the Sage of Six Paths.

// Long before the founding of the hidden villages, the Sage of Six Paths saved the world by sealing the Ten-Tails into his body, becoming its jinchūriki. Some time later, the Sage was inspired by his youngest son, Asura, to use his Creation of All Things ability to divide the Ten-Tails' chakra into nine living entities, what would become the tailed beasts.[4][5] The Sage named the nine and explained to them that a link existed between them despite their separation. He also foretold of a day when they would be brought together again — though not as they were — and that at that time someone would emerge to show them what true power is.[6] In the anime, it was shown that before his death, the Sage and his followers built temples in nine different regions of the world where the tailed beasts could live and be protected.[7] The tailed beasts were originally created not only to prevent the Ten-Tails' resurrection, but also to maintain and balance peace.[8] The first person to come close to their original usage was Hashirama Senju, who had captured several of the tailed beasts with his Wood Release, distributed the beasts amongst the new villages in order to stabilise the balance of power between them. However, Hashirama's usage of the tailed beasts were forceful rather than earning their wilful cooperation.[9] This method would be realised in Hashirama's successor as Asura's reincarnation, Naruto Uzumaki.

// Over the centuries, humanity failed to recognise the tailed beasts as sentient individuals, instead seeing them only as demons, malignant spirits or mindless beasts worthy of fear and disdain. Because of their immense power, the tailed beasts were sought out by humans to be used as weapons in times of war. The beasts resented this treatment and came to hate humans, at times willingly becoming the monsters they were viewed as.[10] In order to harness the beasts' power, the villages began sealing them into humans, creating their own jinchūriki.

// Decades later, after the Third Shinobi World War, an organisation known as Akatsuki begins capturing the villages' jinchūriki in order to extract their tailed beasts and seal them into the Demonic Statue of the Outer Path for the purposes of reviving the Ten-Tails. In order to revive the Ten-Tails, other tailed beasts had to be sealed in order.[11] By the time of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Akatsuki has captured the first seven tailed beasts.[12] In order to capture the last two, the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails, Tobi seals the beasts back into their reincarnated jinchūriki and forces them to fight the Eight-Tails' and Nine-Tails' jinchūriki: Killer B and Naruto Uzumaki, respectively. From Naruto's determination to free them from Tobi and his desire to learn their names, the tailed beasts collectively decide that Naruto is the person the Sage of Six Paths foretold of. They give him portions of their chakra, enabling him to release them from Tobi's control.

// Tailed Beast Reunion
// The tailed beasts reunite with Hagoromo and Naruto.

// Tobi is able to reclaim the freed tailed beasts and, using fragments of the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails' chakra,[13] to prematurely revive the Ten-Tails.[14] Tobi then becomes the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki, but he is defeated by the Allied Shinobi Forces and the tailed beasts are removed from his body.[15] The nine tailed beasts join forces against Tobi's co-conspirator, Madara Uchiha, but he quickly defeats them all and seals them, including the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails, into the Demonic Statue and reforms the Ten-Tails yet again.[16] Madara becomes the Ten-Tails' jinchūriki and attempts to use Infinite Tsukuyomi on the world. Naruto uses the tailed beasts' earlier donations of chakra to try and defeat him, but is unable to do so in time. Madara is afterwards unwittingly used to restore Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, who tries to take what portions of the tailed beasts' chakra Naruto still has.

// Tailed Beast separate from Kaguya
// The nine tailed beasts being freed from the Ten-Tails.

// In one of Kaguya's dimensions, Naruto and Sasuke Uchiha seal Kaguya away and the tailed beasts are extracted from her body, ending the war. Sasuke, however, realising that the struggle for the tailed beasts started the war in the first place, imprisons them with Chibaku Tensei and intends to kill them so the world can't fight over them any longer. Naruto convinces him not to in the end and the tailed beasts are finally released for good.[17] The tailed beasts spread out through the world, free to live as they want; both Gyūki and Kurama decide to return and stay with B and Naruto. However, though they are apart, the tailed beasts' chakra fragments remain within Naruto, allowing his body to act as their "meeting ground".[18]

// Fifteen years after the Fourth Shinobi World War, during the investigation of the Ōtsutsuki clan to find out Kaguya's final fate, two of them began to chase the tailed beasts in order to claim their chakra, starting with Gyūki and Kurama. While Momoshiki Ōtsutsuki and Kinshiki Ōtsutsuki were initially successful in steal an amount of the powers of the respective beasts by capturing their jinchūriki, both ended up being killed by being dominated by the combined power and effort of the Five Kage, Sasuke and Boruto Uzumaki.

// Biju Conference
// The Tailed beasts in a meeting with Naruto during the threat of the Ōtsutsuki.

// Sometime after the defeat of Momoshiki and Kinshiki, when Urashiki Ōtsutsuki began targeting Shukaku for its chakra, it was deduced he was also interested in all the tailed beasts' chakra. Naruto then organised a telepathic meeting with the other tailed beasts, except for Matatabi, Kokuō, and Chōmei, who each refused to accept aid from humans in fear of being captured and used again by them, despite their trust in Naruto, and thus decided to skip the meeting. With the final defeat of Urashiki, the beasts that were being kept safe presumably returned to be free to go their own way.

// Abilities
// Tailed Beast Balls
// The tailed beasts performing their signature technique.

// Tailed beasts are widely believed to be bestial in nature, incapable of the intelligence needed to fully utilise their immense strength. It is thought that only when sealed within humans are they able to benefit from the knowledge of their jinchūriki to use their powers effectively.[19] Though this is not true of the divided tailed beasts, the Ten-Tails does make more wanton use of its powers, not focusing its abilities to the most advantageous end until sealed into a jinchūriki.[20]

// Each of the tailed beasts have their own unique abilities, but they all share the same core attributes: they have massive quantities of powerful chakra — coloured red — far greater than what most shinobi have, can easily transfer their chakra to whomever they choose,[21] and can use the Tailed Beast Ball.[22] Because the tailed beasts are pure chakra, they cannot permanently die; if they or their jinchūriki die, their chakra will re-form in time,[23] usually taking up to hundreds to even possibly thousands of years before their rebirth.[24] In addition, if a large portion of a tailed beast's chakra is separated from it, that chakra becomes a separate, sentient copy of a tailed beast.[25] Using a life sacrificing power up such as Baryon Mode will also have the Tailed Beast's physical form destroyed and die, but would not endanger the life of its jinchūriki.[26] In Kurama’s case, it was able to revive after an unspecific time period in a younger form within the daughter of its previous jinchūriki.[27] Though she only became aware of the Tailed Beast's presence three years after Kurama's death, others could sense intensity from her years before.[28] It is also pointed out that consuming the flesh of a tailed beast is usually deadly for anyone, unless the person is somehow descended from the Sage of Six Paths; in this case, the person will gain abilities similar to a jinchūriki.[29]

// Tailed beasts can communicate telepathically with one another and their jinchūriki, and possess several levels of consciousness. In the initial level, the beast appears to be in a habitat of sorts, typically imprisoned in some way by whatever fūinjutsu was used to seal them.[30][31] The second level is where all the tailed beasts can convene and communicate with one another, free of any restrictions. Jinchūriki are also able to enter this level, but in order to do so, they must be completely linked with their tailed beasts.[32] A freed tailed beast can continue communication with their former jinchūriki, even years after separating.[33] Tailed beasts also have powerful healing capacities, able to mend injuries in themselves and others in seconds.[34]

// Although only shown with Kurama, a tailed beast will become unconscious if they have lost all of their chakra, by either using it, or having it drained from them.[35]

// It has been shown that Tailed Beasts can have more than one conscience or body, as in the Fourth Great Ninja War and onward, Shukaku to Chōmei are present in the real-world, and Gyūki was inside Killer B, while all eight were inside Naruto as well, where they hold meetings. Additionally, a single tailed beast can be forcibly split between a Yin and Yang half, and as previously noted can exist independently of each other as seen with Kurama.
