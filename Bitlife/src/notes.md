Naruto-themed Bitlife: Game Plan
This document outlines the core concepts, mechanics, and narrative structure for a smaller-scaled, Naruto-themed life simulation game inspired by Bitlife.

1. Core Mechanics
Turn-Based Progression: Each "turn" represents one year of the character's life.

Scenario & Choices:

At the start of each turn, a random scenario will pop up.

The player will be presented with 4 choices related to the scenario.

Choosing an option will lead to a consequence that can be:

Good: Positive impact on stats, relationships, or story progression.

Bad: Negative impact on stats, relationships, or story progression.

Neutral/No Impact: The choice has no significant immediate effect.

Morality/Honor System:

Implement a "Morality" system (e.g., Good/Evil alignment) or a "Shinobi Honor" system (e.g., Loyalty, Integrity, Ruthlessness).

Choices made throughout the game will influence this system, affecting future scenarios, relationships, and potential endings. It could potentially be a combination of both.

Squad Mates:

The player will have a limited number of squad mates (e.g., 2).

Interactions and events with squad mates will be integrated into the narrative.

Jobs/Missions:

Instead of many jobs, focus on a limited number of sequential "missions" or "jobs" (e.g., 3 main mission arcs).

These missions will have short time gaps between them, and critically, the outcome and details of each mission will be affected by the player's performance and choices in the previous missions.

2. Narrative Structure
Linear Story with Alternate Endings:

The game will follow a more linear narrative path compared to traditional Bitlife.

Player choices and the morality/honor system will steer the story towards different "climax" points and ultimately, distinct alternate endings.

Possible Endings:

The Hero: Character becomes a respected shinobi/figure.

The Bad Guy: Character descends into villainy.

Early Demise: Character dies early in the story due to choices or random events.

Climax & Recap:

Regardless of the ending, the game will culminate in a "climax" event (often the character's death).

After the climax, a comprehensive recap will be provided, detailing:

The character's life journey.

Key events that led to their ending.

Relevant events that occurred after their death (e.g., impact on the world, legacy).

3. Future Expansion: Legacy System
Carrying On as a Child: If the player character dies early and has a family, the player will have the option to continue playing as one of their children (similar to Bitlife).

Persistent Major Events:

Unique Selling Proposition: Unlike standard Bitlife, major events and consequences from the previous life will carry over and impact the child's life.

Dynamic Storytelling: For example, if the parent character cut off someone's arm and that person survived, the child might encounter that person in the future, potentially as an enemy seeking revenge, or perhaps the person has changed (e.g., "found god") and the encounter is different.

This creates a rich, interconnected generational narrative, where past actions truly echo into the future.

4. Content Generation
Leverage existing stories (movie scripts, novel) for character bases, plot points, and scenario ideas.

Incorporate elements from pop culture (especially Naruto lore) and generic life simulation events to create a diverse range of scenarios.
